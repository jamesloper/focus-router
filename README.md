**A router for React.** This is the most golfed router ever made, and it's no slouch! Focus Router is used across all my companies (one with multi-million dollar revenue). Focus Router's goal is to be opinionated, thorough, and handy.

## About

Most React routers have routes defined in `<Route/>` tags... This is probably a mistake as routes exist outside of React and this would be an example of overuse of Components. Focus Router routes are defined outside of React, and this provides some excellent advantages.

## Example

Here is an example of a simple React app which has a Home Page route, demonstrating the focus of Focus Router.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import Router, { defineRoute } from 'focus-router';

defineRoute('HomePage', '/', () => (
  <div>Home Page</div>
));

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<Router/>);
```

Aside from simplicity, Focus Router has a fuller feature set than React Router (55 KB) which suffers from a lack of focus, which is why this router exists!

1. No need to use `<Link/>`. Just use plain `<a>`tags
2. Swap `useState` for `useParam` or `useQueryParam` to use a browser history-backed global state
3. Supports an omission from nearly all routers-- disabling navigation with `useUnsavedChanges()`
4. Minimal re-renders and maximum micro-optimization

# Install

```bash
npm install focus-router
```

# Documentation

Let's jump in to documentation by going over the most important function first.

## Route Definition

```javascript
import { defineRoute } from 'focus-router';
```

You can put a bunch of these next to each other to define all the routes. You can put these at the root level, even in the same file as `createRoot`. Focus Router will prioritize higher routes first when matching.

```javascript
defineRoute(name, path, component, layout);
```

| Name      | Type                   | Description                                                                                                        |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name      | String *(Required)*    | A unique name for the route. Can be passed as the first argument to `navigation.go()`                              |
| path      | String *(Required)*    | A pattern such as `/blog`. Navigating to a URL that looks like this pattern will cause the route to become active. |
| component | Component *(Required)* | A component to render.                                                                                             |
| layout    | Component *(Optional)* | A component to wrap the component in.                                                                              |

You can re-use concepts from other routers based on [path-to-regexp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp) such as React Router, React Navigation and FlowRouter. For example the following paths are all valid:

- `"/blog/:postId"`
- `"/search/:term?"`
- `"*"`

## Router React Component

```javascript
import Router from 'focus-router';
```

This component will simply render the component for whichever route is active.

Putting these two together, here is an example app!

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import Router, { defineRoute } from 'focus-router';

const Home () => {
  return <div>home</div>
};

const About () => {
  return <div>about</div>
};

defineRoute('Home', '/', Home);
defineRoute('About', '/about', About);
defineRoute('NotFound', '*', () => {
  return <div>not found</div>
});

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
    <a href="/test">Not Found</a>
    <Router/>
  </div>
);

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App/>);
```

## Navigation

``` javascript
import { navigation } from 'focus-router';
```

``` javascript
navigation.go(target, params, queryParams, opts)
```

| Prop     | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `target` | Boolean *(Optional)* | A path or a route name to navigate to. If `target` starts with a slash, it will immediately be navigated to and `params` and `queryParams` are ignored. If target is a `routeName`, a path will be created using all the arguments. |
| `opts`   | Object *(Optional)*  | Navigation options, which are `replaceState` (defaults to false) and `scrollToTop` (defaults to true).                                                                                                                              |

- `{replaceState: true}` will replace the state, instead of adding to the state history.
- `{scrollToTop: false}` will maintain the scroll position across navigations.

``` javascript
navigation.setParams(params, opts)
```

Shortcut for `navigation.go`, only changes the params *(Object)*.

``` javascript
navigation.setQueryParams(params, opts)
```

Shortcut for `navigation.go`, only changes the query params *(Object)*.

## URL Params

``` javascript
import { useParams } from 'focus-router';
```

Simply returns all the params in the current path as an object.

``` javascript
import { useParam } from 'focus-router';
```

```javascript
useParam(key, defaultValue)
```

| Argument       | Type               | Description                                          |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `key`          | String, (Required) | The name of the param to extract from the URL        |
| `defaultValue` | String, (Optional) | Value to return if the key is not present in the URL |

#### Example

```javascript
const id = useParam('id', null);
```

## URL Query Params

``` javascript
import { useQueryParam } from 'focus-router';
```

#### Example

```javascript
const search = useQueryParam('search', '');
```

| Argument       | Type               | Description                                              |
|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `key`          | String, (Required) | The name of the param to extract from the end of the URL |
| `defaultValue` | String, (Optional) | Value to return if the key is not present in the URL     |

## Create Link

``` javascript
import { createLink } from 'focus-router';
```

Returns a URL that can be navigated to. This can be useful to create a dynamic `<a>` tag, or to dynamically go to different routes. `params` and `queryParams` are encoded within the string.

| Argument       | Type                | Description                                                     |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `routeName`    | String *(Required)* | Must match a route name from a `defineRoute()`.                 |
| `params`       | Object *(Optional)* | Params to encode into the path corresponding to the `routeName` |
| `queryParams`  | Object *(Optional)* | Params to encode into the query string                          |

## Use Route Name

``` javascript
import { useRouteName } from 'focus-router';
```

Returns the name *(String)* of the currently presented route.

## Prevent Navigation

``` javascript
import { useUnsavedChanges } from 'focus-router';
```

Using this will cause navigating away from the current URL (such as clicking a link or using the back button) to be ignored. When the stack is empty, the browser's native Save Changes modal will be presented.

| Argument | Type                 | Description                                    |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `active` | Boolean *(Optional)* | Turns the effect on or off                     |

## Bonus Utils

These handy utils are there if you need them, only because focus router needs them internally.

```javascript
import { 
  createBus, 
  useBus,
  encodeQueryString, 
  encodeSearchString, 
  parsePathParams
} from 'focus-router/util';
```
